# 🌐 NLP Specialization (Coursera) – Course Assignments

This repository contains my completed assignments and projects from the **Natural Language Processing Specialization** offered by **DeepLearning.AI** on **Coursera**.

The specialization is a comprehensive, 4-course program that explores the foundations and advanced techniques in modern NLP, ranging from classic models to state-of-the-art neural network architectures.

## 📚 Courses in the Specialization

1. **Natural Language Processing with Classification and Vector Spaces**
2. **Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models**
3. **Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models**
4. **Natural Language Processing with Attention Models**

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

Through the course assignments in this repo, you'll see implementations and applications of the following NLP techniques:

### 🔢 Classical Machine Learning & Word Representations
- Sentiment Analysis using Logistic Regression & Naïve Bayes
- Word vector operations for completing analogies
- Word translation using cosine similarity

### 🧠 Probabilistic Models & Dynamic Programming
- Autocorrect and autocomplete systems
- Part-of-speech tagging with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
- The Viterbi algorithm for sequence decoding

### 🔁 Neural Sequence Models
- Sentiment analysis with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Text generation with LSTMs and GRUs
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) with deep sequence models

### 🎯 Attention Mechanisms & Transformers
- Machine translation using Encoder-Decoder models
- Text summarization with self-attention and causal attention
- Question answering with transformer architectures
